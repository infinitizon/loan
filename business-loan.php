        <h2>Get Cormercial Loan</h2>

        <p>A commercial loan is a debt-based funding arrangement between a
business and a financial institution such as a bank. It is typically
used to fund major capital expenditures and/or cover operational costs
that the company may otherwise be unable to afford.</p>

            <h6>How Commercial Loans Work</h6>

            <p>Commercial loans are granted to a variety of business entities,
usually to assist with short-term funding needs for operational costs
or for the purchase of equipment to facilitate the operating process.
In some instances, the loan may be extended to help the business meet
more basic operational needs, such as funding for payroll or to
purchase supplies used in the production and manufacturing process.


            </p>

          

            <p>These loans often require that a business post collateral, usually in
the form of property, plant or equipment that the bank can confiscate
from the borrower in the event of default or bankruptcy. Sometimes
cash flows generated from future accounts receivable are used as a
loan's collateral. Mortgages issued to commercial real estate are one
form of commercial loan. Apply for your commercial loan from Country
Mortgages & Loan Limited .

        <p>Information on Business Loan: Businesses require an adequate amount of
capital to fund startup expenses or pay for expansions. As such,
companies take out business loans to gain the financial assistance
they need. A business loan is debt that the company is obligated to
repay according to the loan’s terms and conditions. According to the
U.S. Small Business Administration, before approaching a lender for a
loan, it is imperative for the business owners to understand how our
loans work and what we will want to see from the owner.</p>

                <td><strong>A business loan is borrowed capital that companies apply toward
expenses that they are unable to pay for themselves. Some business
owners use business loans to pay for salaries and wages until their
new company gets off the ground, while other companies put borrowed
funds toward office supplies, inventory or business projects. Lenders
want to know how the business intends to use the borrowed monies, so
business owners must make sure to have a clear outline for how the
money will be spent. According to an October 2010 article by David
Bangs in Entrepreneur.com, it is important to impress the lenders by
being professional, or they may decline the loan application. So
before your apply for a business loan from Country Mortgages & Loan
Limited make sure you have a clear outline for how the money will be
spent, send us copy of business executive summary for review, and try
to be professional.</strong></td>

                <td><strong> Loans are not given out for free. Lenders charge interest on loans as
the price paid for borrowing the money. It is important to know
whether the interest is fixed or variable before applying for a loan.
A fixed interest rate means that the interest rate remains the same
for the duration of the loan and its payback period. A variable
interest rate indicates that the interest rate can fluctuate based on
a variety of determinants. Other features of a loan to pay attention
to are the payback period (months or years) and what the lender will
use as collateral if the business is unable to pay the loan back
timely. Our Business loan offer is at 3 percent fix interest rate,
which means the interest rate remains the same for the duration of the
loan and its payback period.

            <h6>Businesses have a variety of loan options to choose from. Traditional
bank loans are the most popular source of funding, however securing a
loan from a bank is no easy task. According to a March 2010 article in
Entrepreneur.com by Karin Price Mueller, banks are tightening their
lending policies due to the economic downfall, making it more
challenging for businesses to receive financial assistance from
commercial loans. Aside from commercial loan options, businesses can
apply for home equity lines of credit if one or more of the company
owners are homeowners. Country Mortgages & Loan Limited offer business
loan at 3% fix interest rate.</h6>

            <h6>Business loans allow companies to have a chance at success. As such,
loans are in high demand, but not every company that applies for a
loan will receive one from Country Mortgages and Loan Limited. When
applying for a business loan, we evaluate the company’s history, the
amount of debt the company has and whether the business seems risky.
Risky businesses, such as startup companies, are often not the winning
recipients of traditional loans.</h6>

 <h4>LOAN APPROVAL.</h4>

        <ul>

          <li><strong>How long are my funds available? :</strong> When you are approved for a Country mortgage  loan you have
15 days to have the funds transferred into your account. Once 15 days
have passed, the application will expire and you will have to re-apply
for a loan.</li>

          <li><strong>Can I get a loan if I work in the cannabis industry?
:</strong> Due to the illegal status of cannabis/marijuana under federal law, and
regulatory restrictions on banks, Country Mortgages & Loan LTD does not accept income that
is derived from the cannabis industry in its loan underwriting
decision. Borrowers are also not permitted to use loan proceeds for
any activity deemed illegal under state or federal law.</li>
