            <h6>Construction  Loans</h6>

            <p>The builder or home buyer takes out a construction
loan to cover the costs of the project before obtaining long-term
funding. Because they are considered relatively risky, construction
loans usually have higher interest rates than traditional mortgage
loans.

   <p><strong>
			A construction loan (also called a home construction loan in
the United States and self-build mortgage in the United Kingdom) is
any value-added loan where the proceeds are used to finance
construction of some kind. In the United Kingdom Financial Services
industry, however, a construction loan is a more specific type of
loan, designed for construction and containing features such as
interest reserves, where repayment ability may be based on something
that can only occur when the project is built. Thus, the defining
features of these loans are special monitoring and guidelines above
normal loan guidelines to ensure that the project is completed so that
repayment can begin to take place.</strong>

       <h4><u>LOAN APPROVAL:</u></h4>

        <ul>

          <li><strong>How long are my funds available? :</strong> When you are approved for a Country mortgage  loan you have
15 days to have the funds transferred into your account. Once 15 days
have passed, the application will expire and you will have to re-apply
for a loan.</li>

          <li><strong>Can I get a loan if I work in the cannabis industry?
:</strong> Due to the illegal status of cannabis/marijuana under federal law, and
regulatory restrictions on banks, Country Mortgages & Loan LTD does not accept income that
is derived from the cannabis industry in its loan underwriting
decision. Borrowers are also not permitted to use loan proceeds for
any activity deemed illegal under state or federal law.</li>
