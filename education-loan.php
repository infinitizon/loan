        <h2>Get the Education Loan</h2>

        <p>Student loan refinancing is commonly used to consolidate multiple
loans into one payment. For example, a recently graduated professional
might have a package of debt that includes private loans, subsidized
federal loans and unsubsidized federal loans.</p>

            <h6>Education Loans</h6>

            <p>Each of these loan types
has a different interest rate, and the private and federal loans are
likely to be serviced by two different companiesâ€”meaning that the
borrower must make two separate payments each month. 
            </p>

            

            <p>By refinancing
their loans and using one lender, the borrower can manage their debt
through one company and possibly lower their interest payment.

 <h4><u>LOAN APPROVAL:</u></h4>

        <ul>

          <li><strong>How long are my funds available? :</strong> When you are approved for a Country mortgage  loan you have
15 days to have the funds transferred into your account. Once 15 days
have passed, the application will expire and you will have to re-apply
for a loan.</li>

          <li><strong>Can I get a loan if I work in the cannabis industry?
:</strong> Due to the illegal status of cannabis/marijuana under federal law, and
regulatory restrictions on banks, Country Mortgages & Loan LTD does not accept income that
is derived from the cannabis industry in its loan underwriting
decision. Borrowers are also not permitted to use loan proceeds for
any activity deemed illegal under state or federal law.</li>
