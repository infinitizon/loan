 <h6>What Is Capital Funding?
</h6>

       
<p><strong> is the act of providing resources to finance
a need, program, or project. While this is usually in the form of
money, it can also take the form of effort or time from an
organization or company. Generally, this word is used when a firm uses
its internal reserves to satisfy its necessity for cash, while the
term financing is used when the firm acquires capital from external
sources. </strong>  </p>
        <p>Capital funding is the money that lenders and equity holders
provide to a business for daily and long-term needs. A company's
capital funding consists of both debt (bonds) and equity (stock). The
business uses this money for operating capital. The bond and equity
holders expect to earn a return on their investment in the form of
interest, dividends, and stock appreciation.
</p>
<p>Capital funding is the money given to businesses by lenders and equity
holders to cover the cost of operations. </p>


        <h4>LOAN APPROVAL.</h4>

        <ul>

          <li><strong>How long are my funds available? :</strong> When you are approved for a Country mortgage  loan you have
15 days to have the funds transferred into your account. Once 15 days
have passed, the application will expire and you will have to re-apply
for a loan.</li>

          <li><strong>Can I get a loan if I work in the cannabis industry?
:</strong> Due to the illegal status of cannabis/marijuana under federal law, and
regulatory restrictions on banks, Country Mortgages & Loan LTD does not accept income that
is derived from the cannabis industry in its loan underwriting
decision. Borrowers are also not permitted to use loan proceeds for
any activity deemed illegal under state or federal law.</li>
