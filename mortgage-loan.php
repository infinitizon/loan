        <h2>Get Mortgage Loan</h2>

        <p>A mortgage loan or, simply, mortgage is used either by purchasers of
real property to raise funds to buy real estate, or alternatively by
existing property owners to raise funds for any purpose, while putting
a lien on the property being mortgaged. The loan is "secured" on the
borrower's property through a process known as mortgage origination.
This means that a legal mechanism is put into place which allows the
lender to take possession and sell the secured property ("foreclosure"
or "repossession") to pay off the loan in the event the borrower
defaults on the loan or otherwise fails to abide by its terms. </p>

            <p>
The
word mortgage is derived from a Law French term used in Britain in the
Middle Ages meaning "death pledge" and refers to the pledge ending
(dying) when either the obligation is fulfilled or the property is
taken through foreclosure.

            </p>

            <h6>"A mortgage can also be described as "a
borrower giving consideration in the form of a collateral for a
benefit (loan)"</h6>

            <p>Mortgage borrowers can be individuals mortgaging their home or they
can be businesses mortgaging commercial property (for example, their
own business premises, residential property let to tenants, or an
investment portfolio).

        <h4>More about Mortgage Loan.</h4>

        <p>The lender will typically be a financial
institution, such as a bank, credit union or building society,
depending on the country concerned, and the loan arrangements can be
made either directly or indirectly through intermediaries.</p>
<p> Features of
mortgage loans such as the size of the loan, maturity of the loan,
interest rate, method of paying off the loan, and other
characteristics can vary considerably. The lender's rights over the
secured property take priority over the borrower's other creditors,
which means that if the borrower becomes bankrupt or insolvent, the
other creditors will only be repaid the debts owed to them from a sale
of the secured property if the mortgage lender is repaid in full
first.
</p>
<p>In countries where the demand for home ownership is highest, strong
domestic markets for mortgages have developed. Mortgages can either be
funded through the banking sector (that is, through short-term
deposits) or through the capital markets through a process called
"securitization", which converts pools of mortgages into fungible
bonds that can be sold to investors in small denominations. </p>

        <h4>LOAN APPROVAL.</h4>

        <ul>

          <li><strong>How long are my funds available? :</strong> When you are approved for a Country mortgage  loan you have
15 days to have the funds transferred into your account. Once 15 days
have passed, the application will expire and you will have to re-apply
for a loan.</li>

          <li><strong>Can I get a loan if I work in the cannabis industry?
:</strong> Due to the illegal status of cannabis/marijuana under federal law, and
regulatory restrictions on banks, Country Mortgages & Loan LTD does not accept income that
is derived from the cannabis industry in its loan underwriting
decision. Borrowers are also not permitted to use loan proceeds for
any activity deemed illegal under state or federal law.</li>
