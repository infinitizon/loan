            <h6>What Is Debt Consolidation?
</h6>

            <p>Debt consolidation is the process of combining several debts you
already owe together into a single, new account. Once combined, you
make one monthly payment to take care of your total credit obligation.

            </p>

           

            <p>The term debt consolidation can describe a few different approaches to
combining debts, including:

<p><strong>Applying for a new consolidation loan to refinance existing debt
Using a credit card balance transfer to consolidate debt
With both approaches above, debt consolidation can roll several
existing financial obligations into one. Ideally, with either option,
your goal should be to obtain a lower interest rate and better terms.
In general, debt consolidation is limited to unsecured credit
obligations. These may include credit cards, student loans, and
unsecured installment loans you currently owe. Medical bills may also
fit into this category.  </strong>  </p>
        <p>With debt consolidation loans, you can pay off high-interest debts
like credit cards. If your new loan features a lower interest rate
than you were paying before, you could save money in interest fees.

        <h4>LOAN APPROVAL.</h4>

        <ul>

          <li><strong>How long are my funds available? :</strong> When you are approved for a Country mortgage  loan you have
15 days to have the funds transferred into your account. Once 15 days
have passed, the application will expire and you will have to re-apply
for a loan.</li>

          <li><strong>Can I get a loan if I work in the cannabis industry?
:</strong> Due to the illegal status of cannabis/marijuana under federal law, and
regulatory restrictions on banks, Country Mortgages & Loan LTD does not accept income that
is derived from the cannabis industry in its loan underwriting
decision. Borrowers are also not permitted to use loan proceeds for
any activity deemed illegal under state or federal law.</li>
