 <h6>What Is Refinance Loan?
</h6>

       
<p><strong>Refinancing a loan allows a borrower to replace their current debt
obligation with one that has more favorable terms. Through this
process, a borrower takes out a new loan to pay off their existing
debt, and the terms of the old loan are replaced by the updated
agreement. This enables borrowers to redo their loan to get a lower
monthly payment, different term length or a more convenient payment
structure. Most consumer lenders who offer traditional loans also
offer refinancing options. However, for products like mortgages and
car loans, refinancing loans tend to come with slightly higher
interest rates than purchase loans. </strong>  </p>
        <p>With debt consolidation loans, you can pay off high-interest debts
like credit cards. If your new loan features a lower interest rate
than you were paying before, you could save money in interest fees.
</p>



        <h4>LOAN APPROVAL.</h4>

        <ul>

          <li><strong>How long are my funds available? :</strong> When you are approved for a Country mortgage  loan you have
15 days to have the funds transferred into your account. Once 15 days
have passed, the application will expire and you will have to re-apply
for a loan.</li>

          <li><strong>Can I get a loan if I work in the cannabis industry?
:</strong> Due to the illegal status of cannabis/marijuana under federal law, and
regulatory restrictions on banks, Country Mortgages & Loan LTD does not accept income that
is derived from the cannabis industry in its loan underwriting
decision. Borrowers are also not permitted to use loan proceeds for
any activity deemed illegal under state or federal law.</li>
